# Subscription-Cancellation

This project aims to analyze and predict subscription cancellations based on users' previous history. By leveraging data analysis and visualization tools, we explore patterns and factors contributing to cancellations, providing insights that can help improve retention strategies.

## Requirements

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
